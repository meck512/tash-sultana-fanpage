    <p1>This Australian musician has had musical genius pouring out of their soul since they were old enough to hold a
        guitar. It’s no secret this multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, and producer is one of the most original
        and creative musicians of our time. Beginning their career busking on the streets, Sultana was a sight to see
        showcasing their creative looping techniques.</p1>
    <p2>Years later Tash released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vn8phH0k5HI" target="_blank">"Jungle"</a> on
        social media, recorded from their bedroom. The video immediately went viral with one million views in five days.
        Leading to the J Award for “Unearthed Artist of the Year”. That video debut of “Jungle” now has over one hundred
        million views and counting.</p2>

        start of Tash's rise, personal home videos from Tash's family + interviews with friends, family and the tight
